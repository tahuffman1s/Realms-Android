# Realms of Fate — Android

Kotlin + Jetpack Compose RPG game. Package: `com.realmsoffate.game`. Build system: Gradle with Kotlin DSL.

## Agent Model Rule

Opus (you) handles planning, design, architecture, and coordination. Sonnet handles execution.

- **Dispatch all agents with `model: "sonnet"`** — implementation, exploration, review, research.
- **Opus does the thinking** — brainstorming, writing plans, reviewing agent output, making judgment calls. Never delegate these to agents.
- **Write agent prompts optimized for Sonnet** — be explicit and literal. Include exact file paths, line numbers, code snippets, and expected outcomes. Sonnet executes precisely what you specify; don't ask it to make design decisions or explore alternatives.
- **Low-priority tasks** (typos, one-line fixes) don't need agents — do them yourself.

## Task Execution Protocol

When the user gives you work, follow this protocol exactly.

### Step 1 — Triage

Interpret the user's request and break it into discrete tasks. Classify each task into one of three priority tiers:

| Priority | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **High** | Architectural changes, multi-file refactors, new features touching 3+ files, bug fixes that require deep investigation | New game system, data layer rework, complex UI flow |
| **Normal** | Self-contained changes in 1-2 files, straightforward bug fixes, adding a screen or component | Add a button, fix a crash with a known cause, update a prompt |
| **Low** | Cosmetic tweaks, copy changes, formatting, small cleanup | Fix a typo, adjust padding, rename a variable |

Present the triage to the user as a numbered checklist before starting work:

```
## Task Plan
### High Priority
- [ ] 1. <task> — (N agents)
### Normal Priority
- [ ] 2. <task>
### Low Priority
- [ ] 3. <task>
```

### Step 2 — Execute by Priority

**High priority tasks — first, in parallel where possible.**
- Use `superpowers:brainstorming` before designing new features or systems.
- Use `superpowers:writing-plans` for multi-step tasks touching 3+ files, then `superpowers:executing-plans` to execute.
- Use `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` or `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` to coordinate parallel work.
- Use `superpowers:systematic-debugging` before investigating bugs.
- Use `superpowers:test-driven-development` when adding new game mechanics or reducers.
- Use `frontend-design:frontend-design` when building or redesigning any Compose UI (screens, overlays, panels, HUD elements).
- Use `feature-dev:feature-dev` for guided feature development with codebase exploration and architecture focus.
- Break each high-priority task into independent sub-sections (e.g. data layer, UI, viewmodel).
- Dispatch a separate Claude Sonnet agent (`model: "sonnet"`) for each sub-section using the Agent tool. Run independent agents in parallel within a single message.
- Each agent prompt must be self-contained: include file paths, line numbers, what to change, and why. Do not delegate understanding.
- After all agents return, review every file they touched by reading the actual changes. Trust but verify.

**Normal priority tasks — second, sequentially.**
- Dispatch a single Claude Sonnet agent (`model: "sonnet"`) for each normal-priority task.
- Same rules: self-contained prompt, verify changes after.

**Low priority tasks — last, do them yourself.**
- Handle these directly without spawning agents. They should be quick.

### Step 3 — Update the Checklist

After completing each task, mark it done and tell the user what changed:

```
- [x] 1. <task> — Done. Changed X, Y, Z.
```

When all tasks are done, print the final checklist so the user sees the full summary.

### Step 4 — Test

Run the full test suite after all tasks are complete:

```bash
gradle test
```

**If tests pass:** proceed to Step 5.

**If tests fail:**
- Read the failure output. Diagnose whether the failure is caused by your changes or was pre-existing.
- Fix broken tests. If your changes altered behavior that existing tests assert, update the tests to match the new correct behavior — do not delete tests to make them pass.
- If you added new game mechanics, reducers, or parser logic, **write new tests** for them (see Testing section below).
- Re-run `gradle test` after fixes. Cap at 3 retry cycles; if still failing, stop and present the remaining failures to the user.

### Step 5 — Build and Deploy

After tests pass, build and install to any connected device (emulator or phone) in one step:

```bash
gradle installDebug && adb shell am start -n com.realmsoffate.game/.MainActivity
```

This builds the debug APK, pushes it to the connected device, and launches the app. If no device is connected, either start the emulator (`emulator -avd Pixel7 &`) or run `phone` (the fish function) which handles ADB reconnection to the Galaxy S23 automatically.

**If the build succeeds:** report success. The app is already running on the phone.

**If the build fails:** read the full error output, then:
- Diagnose each error.
- Dispatch Claude Sonnet agents (`model: "sonnet"`) to fix each independent error in parallel.
- After fixes land, rebuild. Re-run tests if fixes touched logic.
- Repeat this diagnose-fix-rebuild loop until the build succeeds.
- Cap at 5 retry cycles. If still failing after 5 attempts, stop and present the remaining errors to the user.

### Step 6 — Verify and Finish

- Use `superpowers:verification-before-completion` before claiming work is done — run tests and build, confirm output, then report.
- Use `commit-commands:commit` or `commit-commands:commit-push-pr` for git operations when the user asks to commit or create a PR.
- Use `superpowers:requesting-code-review` after completing a major feature or before merging.
- Use `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` when implementation is complete and you need to decide how to integrate.

### Step 7 — Update README

If your changes altered any of the following, update `README.md` to reflect reality:

- **Project structure** — files added, removed, or moved
- **Game systems** — new mechanics, changed AI integration, new tag types
- **Build requirements** — new dependencies, SDK version changes, new build commands
- **Tech stack** — new libraries, architecture changes

Do not update the README for internal refactors, bug fixes, or changes invisible to someone reading the project overview. The README describes *what the project is*, not *what changed today*.

## Environment Setup

First-time setup on Arch Linux (installs JDK 17/21, Android SDK, emulator, Node.js):

```bash
./setup-env.sh
```

The script creates a **Pixel7** AVD (Android 16 / API 36.1, x86_64 with Google APIs) for local emulator testing. Requires KVM — AMD-V or VT-x must be enabled in BIOS.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Debug APK
gradle assembleDebug

# Release APK
gradle assembleRelease

# Run lint
gradle lint

# Run tests
gradle test

# Clean
gradle clean
```

## Versioning & Releases

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- **MAJOR** — breaking changes or graduation to production (1.0.0 = first Play Store release)
- **MINOR** — new features, new game systems, significant UI changes
- **PATCH** — bug fixes, balance tweaks, prompt adjustments, cosmetic changes

### Version source of truth

`app/build.gradle.kts` contains both `versionName` (semver string) and `versionCode` (integer for Play Store). The `versionCode` is always derived from `versionName`:

```
versionCode = MAJOR * 10000 + MINOR * 100 + PATCH
```

Never set `versionCode` independently — always compute it from the version string.

### When to bump versions

**On release only.** Normal commits do NOT touch version numbers. Versions change exclusively when the user requests a release.

### Release protocol

When the user says "release", "cut a release", "tag a release", or similar:

1. **Determine bump type** from the work done since the last tag. If ambiguous, ask the user. Use `git log` to review changes since the last `v*` tag.
2. **Compute** the new `versionName` and `versionCode`.
3. **Update** `versionName` and `versionCode` in `app/build.gradle.kts`.
4. **Commit** with message: `Release vX.Y.Z`.
5. **Tag** with an annotated tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"`.
6. **Push** the commit and tag: `git push && git push --tags`.

The tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which runs tests, builds the release APK, and creates a GitHub Release with the APK attached.

### Example

```bash
# What Claude does when you say "release":
# 1. Bumps app/build.gradle.kts: versionName = "0.2.0", versionCode = 200
# 2. git commit -m "Release v0.2.0"
# 3. git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0"
# 4. git push && git push --tags
# → GitHub Actions builds APK + creates release automatically
```

## Release Signing

Release APKs are signed with an upload keystore. The signing config in `app/build.gradle.kts` reads credentials from two sources (in order):

1. **Local builds** — `keystore.properties` in the project root (gitignored):
   ```properties
   storeFile=../realms-upload.jks
   storePassword=<password>
   keyAlias=realms
   keyPassword=<password>
   ```

2. **CI builds** — environment variables from GitHub Secrets:
   - `KEYSTORE_BASE64` — base64-encoded `.jks` file
   - `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` — keystore password
   - `KEY_ALIAS` — key alias (e.g. `realms`)
   - `KEY_PASSWORD` — key password

If neither source is configured, the release build produces an unsigned APK.

### Setting up GitHub Secrets

To enable signed CI releases, the user must add these secrets to the repo (Settings → Secrets → Actions):

```bash
# Encode the keystore for GitHub Secrets:
base64 -w0 realms-upload.jks | pbcopy  # or xclip on Linux
```

Then add `KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, and `KEY_PASSWORD` as repository secrets.

### APK naming

Release APKs are named `realms-of-fate-vX.Y.Z-release.apk` automatically via `archivesBaseName` in `build.gradle.kts`.

## Testing

### Test structure

```
app/src/test/kotlin/com/realmsoffate/game/
├── data/
│   └── TagParserTest.kt              12 tests — tokenizer + segment parser
└── game/
    ├── ApplyParsedIntegrationTest.kt  14 tests — full turn pipeline via reducers
    ├── MerchantHandlerTest.kt         9 tests — buy/sell/buyback/exchange/haggle
    ├── RestHandlerTest.kt             7 tests — short rest, long rest, death saves
    ├── SaveServiceTest.kt             5 tests — export, filenames, snapshots
    ├── ProgressionHandlerTest.kt      7 tests — stat points, feats, level-up
    ├── GameStateFixture.kt            Test helpers: character(), baseState(), viewModelWithState()
    └── ParsedReplyBuilder.kt          Fluent builder for ParsedReply test payloads
```

Tests run on Robolectric (SDK 34) with JUnit 4. No instrumented tests — everything runs on JVM.

### When to write tests

| Changed | Required |
|---------|----------|
| New reducer or modified reducer logic | Add cases to `ApplyParsedIntegrationTest` using `ParsedReplyBuilder` |
| New tag type or changed tag parsing | Add cases to `TagParserTest` |
| New handler (Phase III: Merchant, Rest, Save, Progression) | Add cases to the handler's existing test class |
| Bug fix in game logic | Add a regression test that would have caught the bug |
| UI-only changes, prompt text changes, cosmetic tweaks | No test needed |

### How to write tests

**For reducer/applyParsed tests:** Use the existing fixtures.

```kotlin
@Test fun `your test name`() {
    val vm = viewModelWithState(baseState(
        character = character(hp = 50, maxHp = 100)
    ))
    val parsed = ParsedReplyBuilder()
        .heal(20)
        .narration("You feel restored.")
        .build()

    vm.applyParsed(parsed, diceResult = null)

    val state = vm.readUiState()
    assertEquals(70, state.character.hp)
}
```

**For tag parser tests:** Feed raw AI output strings to the tokenizer and assert segment types/content.

```kotlin
@Test fun `your test name`() {
    val segments = tokenize("[NPC_DIALOG:merchant]\"Fresh wares!\"/[NPC_DIALOG]")
    assertEquals(1, segments.size)
    assertEquals(SegmentType.NPC_DIALOG, segments[0].type)
    assertEquals("merchant", segments[0].speaker)
}
```

### Test commands

```bash
# All tests
gradle test

# Specific test class
gradle test --tests "com.realmsoffate.game.data.TagParserTest"
gradle test --tests "com.realmsoffate.game.game.ApplyParsedIntegrationTest"
```

- Any library where your training data might be stale

## Deploying to a device

Two deployment targets are available: the physical phone and the local emulator. Both use the same `gradle installDebug` pipeline.

### Emulator

Launch the emulator, then build and deploy:

```bash
# Start the emulator (runs in the background)
emulator -avd Pixel7 &

# Wait for boot, then deploy
adb wait-for-device && gradle installDebug && adb shell am start -n com.realmsoffate.game/.MainActivity
```

The AVD `Pixel7` is created by `setup-env.sh`. If it doesn't exist, create it:

```bash
echo "no" | avdmanager create avd -n "Pixel7" -k "system-images;android-36.1;google_apis;x86_64" -d "pixel_7"
```

### Physical phone (Galaxy S23)

The paired Android target is a Galaxy S23 (`SM-S916U`) on the local LAN. A fish function `phone` is installed at `~/.config/fish/functions/phone.fish` that wraps the full cycle: reconnect if needed → `gradle installDebug` → launch `MainActivity`. Run it from the repo root:

```
phone
```

#### Under the hood

The function:
1. Checks `adb devices` for at least one entry in `device` state.
2. If none, runs `adb connect 192.168.68.64:44547` (the last-known ADB port).
3. If still no device, prints reconnection instructions and exits non-zero.
4. Runs `gradle installDebug`.
5. Runs `adb shell am start -n com.realmsoffate.game/.MainActivity`.

### When the port rotates

Android's wireless ADB port changes on reboots, Wi-Fi drops, or toggling the Wireless debugging switch. When `phone` reports it can't reach the phone:

1. Open **Settings → System → Developer options → Wireless debugging** on the phone.
2. Note the current port shown at the top of that screen.
3. Either run once-off: `adb connect 192.168.68.64:<new-port>`
4. Or edit `~/.config/fish/functions/phone.fish` and update `phone_port` so the reconnect path stays automatic.

The one-time pairing (via **Pair device with pairing code**) does NOT need to be redone — pairing identity persists across ports. Only re-pair if you wipe the phone, reset developer options, or hit "Revoke authorizations".

## Debugging workflow

The in-game Debug button (More menu → Debug) dumps the full game state + AI exchange log to the app's scoped external storage on the phone:

```
/sdcard/Android/data/com.realmsoffate.game/files/debug/debug_<character>_T<turn>_<epoch>.txt
```

No file picker — one tap writes the dump. To pull it to the PC, run the fish function from anywhere inside the repo:

```
pulldebug
```

It yanks the newest file into `<repo-root>/debug-dumps/` (gitignored) and prints the local path. Falls back to `~/Downloads/` only when run from outside a git repo. Needs the same wireless ADB pairing that `phone` uses.

### For Claude sessions

When the user asks to "check the latest debug dump" or similar, the freshest dump is always at:

```
ls -t debug-dumps/debug_*.txt 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

Read that file directly — no need to ask the user for the path. Files are named `debug_<characterslot>_T<turn>_<epoch>.txt` so newest-by-mtime is also newest-by-turn for a given character.

## Debug Bridge (debug builds only)

An HTTP server on port 8735 that gives Claude Code full access to the app's state, UI, and commands. Only active in debug builds. Zero release footprint — all code lives in `app/src/debug/`.

### Setup (once per session)

```bash
adb -s emulator-5554 forward tcp:8735 tcp:8735
```

For real-time events, start logcat in background:
```bash
adb -s emulator-5554 logcat -s RealmsDebug:V
```
